The Movielens 100K dataset.  The dataset contains of around 1lac ratings given to about 9066 movies by around 671 users. 

I have implemented Collaborative Filtering using Matrix Factorization with Keras Embeddings to predict the unknown ratings. Also I have used a NN to make predictions.  

Finally I have tried to minimize the Mean squared Error on the training set. I have achieved a decent validation loss of 0.84.
